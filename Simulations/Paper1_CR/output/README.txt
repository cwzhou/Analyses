This folder is for output generated from CR01.Simulation_Run.R in the 0_simulations folder. However, the rds here is all local data because we run the real thing on the UNC longleaf cluster and do not transfer that data to the local machine. AKA everything is run on the server. We can then run CR02.Simulation_Summary.R on the server to create plots then use github to transfer those .eps files over.
